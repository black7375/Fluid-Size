#+TITLE:Fluid Size

A method of fluidly resizing in response to various devices. (with SASS)

It is a way to respond to the distance between the eye and the device, the size and resolution of the device.

** Install
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
## Yarn
yarn add fluid-size

## NPM
npm install fluid-size

## Github Repository
npm install fluid-size
#+END_SRC

** How to Use?
Just use the name of the API with =@include= !!
#+BEGIN_SRC scss
 @include font-size($size-value, $max-size-value); 
#+END_SRC

** Principle

Use visual angles to determine the =fit size= (I called) for each device.

** Calculation process

1. Size specification
2. Angle calculations in the devices that would look the smallest(or can you specify which device to reference?)
3. Generate a `fit size` for each device based on the angle
4. Provides fluidity between devices
